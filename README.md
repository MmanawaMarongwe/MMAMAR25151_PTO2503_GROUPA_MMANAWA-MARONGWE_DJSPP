# 🎧 DJSPP: React Podcast App – Global State, Playback & Persistence

## Project Overview

In this project, a fully featured podcast application is developed as the final evolution of the React Podcast Explorer. Building on dynamic routing and show detail navigation, this version introduces global state management, persistent user interactions, uninterrupted audio playback, and production deployment practices.

Users can browse podcast shows, explore seasons and episodes, play audio across routes without interruption, favourite episodes, and personalise their experience through theme preferences — all while maintaining a responsive and seamless single‑page application experience.

The project demonstrates the ability to manage complex shared state, coordinate asynchronous behaviour across components, and implement production‑ready React architecture.

---

## Core Objectives

- Implement **global state management** using React Context API.
- Create a **persistent global audio player** that continues playback across routes.
- Enable **episode favouriting** with localStorage persistence.
- Implement a **recommended shows carousel** for improved discovery.
- Add a **light/dark theme toggle** with saved user preference.
- Configure **SPA deployment routing** to prevent refresh 404 errors.
- Handle asynchronous state safely during navigation and playback.
- Maintain a fully **responsive UI** across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Deliverables

### 1. Global Audio Playback System

✅ Single shared audio player accessible across the entire application.
✅ Playback continues when navigating between pages.
✅ Displays episode metadata including title, season, and episode.
✅ Uses a unique `trackId` to correctly replay episodes.
✅ Playback state persisted using `localStorage`.
✅ Browser confirmation prompt shown when leaving during playback.

---

### 2. Episode Favourites System

✅ Users can favourite or unfavourite individual episodes.
✅ Favourites stored persistently using `localStorage`.
✅ Episodes grouped by show for structured data management.
✅ Dedicated Favourites page for easy access.
✅ Sorting options for show group include:
  - Title A–Z / Z–A
  - Newest added / Oldest added

---

### 3. Recommended Shows Carousel

✅ Horizontally scrollable carousel implemented using Swiper.js.
✅ Displays recommended podcasts with images and genre tags.
✅ Swipe and arrow navigation supported.
✅ Responsive breakpoints adjust visible items by screen size.
✅ Automatically excludes the currently viewed show when applicable.

---

### 4. Theme Toggle & Personalisation

✅ Light and Dark mode support using CSS variables.
✅ Theme preference stored in `localStorage`.
✅ Instant global UI updates across all components.

---

### 5. Production Deployment Configuration

- Application deployed to **Vercel**.
- SPA rewrite rule prevents 404 errors on refresh for dynamic routes.
- Routes such as `/show/:id` load correctly in production.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```

---

### 6. Responsive Design

- Mobile‑first layout adjustments.
- Episode and content layouts adapt for smaller screens.
- Carousel breakpoints optimise viewing across devices.

---

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- React Context API for shared global state
- Persistent state using localStorage
- Controlled side effects with `useEffect`
- Memoization using `useMemo`
- Dynamic routing with React Router
- Functional state updates
- Separation of logic and presentation components
- Production SPA deployment practices

---

## Panel Review Preparation

Prepared to explain:

- How global audio playback persists across routes
- Why Context API was chosen over prop drilling
- How favourites are grouped
- How memoization improves rendering performance
- How localStorage persistence is safely initialized
- How asynchronous playback and navigation states are coordinated
